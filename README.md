# Keeper

Keeper simplifies storage of state. Just point where it should be saved, and keeper takes care of the rest. You don't need to write code to load, save, and convert data, keeper takes care of that for you.

## 📜 Features

- ✅ Sync storage
- ❌ Async storage
- ❌ MobX store support
- ❌ Imports with library prefix
- ❌ Function types
  
Supported storage types:

- ✅ In-memory storage 
- ❌ Hive storage (through keeper_hive)

<sub>✅ Available | 🚧 Under development | ❌ Unsupported</sub>

## 🛠️ Getting started

Keeper relies on code generation to save you the trouble of writing storage code. The code is generated by `keeper_codegen` which requires `build_runner`.

⚠️ This is an experimental project. Use with caution.

## 💻 Usage

In `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  keeper: ^0.0.1

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.1.5 # check for recent version on pub.dev
  keeper_codegen: ^0.0.1 # check for recent version on pub.dev
```

In your Dart file import `keeper`:

```dart
import 'package:keeper/keeper.dart';
```

Set up the storage key:

```dart
KeepKey counterValue() => MemoryKeep().key('counter_value');
```

And set up the class:

```dart
part 'counter.g.dart';

class Counter = _Counter with _$CounterKeeper;

@kept
class _Counter {
  @At(counterValue)
  int value = 0;

  void increment() {
    value++;
  }
}
```

When the value changes it will now be automatically stored.

Different storage mechanisms may require different initialization.
